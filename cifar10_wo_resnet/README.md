# Purpose:
To see the results what if i dont use ResNet advantages. Without having well-run weights and biases that comes from pretrained model of Resnet, i would expect that the model takes time in training. Also results must be slighly lower than the resnet's. But in order to enhance the model, i apply data augmentation to dataset so that it would give more sensible information even though it is very limitted by comparing the dataset that was used in training ResNet.
